Good string
You are given a string S of length N consisting of digits 1 and 2. A string is considered as good if you can start at index 1 and reach index N, visiting each index exactly once and ending at the last index. At each index, you can move 1 or 2 steps to the left or right depending on whether the digit is 1 or 2.
Example
Assumptions
• N= 3
• S= "122"
Approach
As it's not possible that you start from index 1 and end at index 3 by visiting each index exactly once. So the answer would be NO.
